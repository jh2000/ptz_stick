This project let's you create a small&cheap wireless PTZ Controller for various applications.
The code is currently for TRENDnetView EVO, a central recording/viewing solution (free but a little limited).
The PTZ-Cameras i tested it with are TRENDnet TV-IP420P and TV-IP440PI.


Parts used:
AZ-Delivery ESP32-WROOM-32/NodeMCU or similar
DollaTek 1.8" TFT Display ST7735S from https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07QJVG8QX
TEKO 790.9 Stand Case from https://www.amazon.de/dp/B003A69O6C
JH-D400X-R4 10K 4D PTZ-Stick from https://www.amazon.de/dp/B088W8D8SB
KY-040 360Â° rotary controller from https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07B68H6R8
USB-B to micro-USB Adapter from https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0C3HGHKTF
short micro-usb cable from https://www.amazon.de/dp/B095JZSHXQ

In the initial release the camera IDs are hardcoded but should be queried from the Server in a future release.
The display shows some raw values aswell as calculated things, but kinda unsorted and is hard WIP.
The stick can be calibrated to give a good zero position with a dead zone and linear movement.
NVS is not in use but i intend to save the calibration or something similar to it.


Initialy i wanted to use a 1602 LCD Display which didn't fit into the case. So there is no intention (and i think it just won't work) to get the camera picture onto the TFT. This needs to be done on separate hardware!
